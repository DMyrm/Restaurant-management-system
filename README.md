# Restaurant management system

This is an application implementing a restaurant management system. The system has two types of users: administrator and waiter. The administrator can add, delete and modify existing products from the menu. The waiter can create a new order for a table, add elements from the menu, and compute the bill for an order.

## Usage
The application can be run with the following command :
```
java -jar RestaurantSystem.jar
```

## Functionality

The aplication has GUIs for both types of users and can comunicate data from one to another on page update . This way every time a new item is added or modified the waiter can see it too and use said new items for creating orders.
